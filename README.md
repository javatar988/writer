writer App - digital14

writer app contain 1 abstract class "Writer.java" and 2 classes extending "writer" (FileWriter.java,StringWriter.java) 

the intion to make "Writer.java" class abstract is that a all classes can use current writer implementation or write their on implementation


also read() method in the abstract class should be in a separate abstract class or interface with other methods that works only for Reading purposes in fully implmented solution that include (Writing & Reading)
