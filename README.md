writer App - digital14

writer app contains 1 abstract class "Writer.java" and 2 classes extending  (FileWriter.java,StringWriter.java)

the intention to make the "Writer.java" class abstract is that all classes can use the current writer.java implementation or write their own implementation


also read() method in the abstract class should be in a separate abstract class or interface with other methods that work only for Reading purposes in fully implemented solutions that include (Writing & Reading)
