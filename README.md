# writer
writer App - digital14

writer app contain 1 abstract class "writer" and 2 classes extending "writer" (FileWriter,StringWriter)
the reason I made the class abstract is that  a child class can use current writer implementation or write their on implementation

also read method in the abstract class should be in a separate abstract class with other method that works only for reading purposes in fully implmentes solution
